<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="doubll">============</p>

<p>The great delay and ruinous expenses of a Chancery suit have become
proverbial. Shame to the country, that suffers such a stain upon its
system of equitable jurisprudence! I offer no apology for taking up the
tomahawk of censure against this dire national enemy. Would that I could
use the weapon more dexterously! It must, however, be sufficient
satisfaction for me to have removed the scalp of concealment, without
being too particular about the skill, with which it has been effected.</p>

<p>As a poet, I must throw myself upon the indulgence of the public. For
the last ten years I have sacrificed every literary attainment to the
study of the law; and am therefore in the situation of a miner, who,
after years of cheerless labour underground, should be expected to
display any great ingenuity in the pursuit of a more enlightened
occupation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span></p><p>The subject is dull, but not unfruitful. I have thrown into the work as
much amusement as my poor abilities would furnish me with, but my
principal objects have been truth and consistency.&mdash;I presume,
therefore, to assert that I have always been honest in commendation, and
never severe without reason.
</p>

<p>I wish it to be distinctly understood that, in my character of a vicious
attorney, I do not mean to represent the profession at large. There are
in town and country many upright practitioners, of whose friendship I
should feel proud. A lawyer, however, may be often dishonest without the
fear of detection, and indeed almost without the consciousness of doing
wrong. In his practice the boundaries between good and evil are very
slight, and may be imperceptibly transgressed. There is little merit in
one, whom the fear of punishment deters from the commission of crime;
but not to practice knavery when it can be done with ease and infinity
is at all events a negative virtue deserving of no slight consideration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The idea of writing this poem first occurred to me in the Park of
Fontainebleau, where I composed the greater part of it. During its
progress I have had no opportunity of referring to any publication on
the subject, and have, therefore, been compelled to draw very largely on
my memory. This must be my excuse for any errors into which I may have
fallen.</p>

<p class="doubll">============</p>

<p>The evils of the Court of Chancery have latterly been so much discussed,
that I have thought it unnecessary to enter into long explanations upon
the different objects of censure contained in the poem. The notes,
therefore, contain only such observations as appeared absolutely
necessary to make some of the verses more intelligible than could be
effected in poetry, without a very tedious and dull circumlocution. The
books of Chancery, practice and the report of the commissioners
appointed to investigate the subject, will supply all deficiencies of
this sort.</p>

the corn-field. It lays the foundation of his professional harvest. From
the conferences of that day spring all his actions at law, and his
chancery suits. Litigation, encouraged by legal advice and good ale,
warms into action, and is no longer restrained by the dictates of sober
prudence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Every one knows the difficulty of reading Bell’s opinions.
He is said to have three sorts of hand writing: the first he can read
himself, but his clerk cannot. The second his clerk can read, but he
cannot. The third, no human being; no, not even the most learned
decipherer of hieroglyphics, can make out.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> I mean no personal disrespect to Mr. Bell, whose superior
talents I freely acknowledge; but such are the opinions of most counsel,
and on such precious morsels of indecision are founded chancery suits
without number.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This is a scene from Lincolns Inn. There is not a draftsman
or solicitor, that will not feel the truth of it; the one with conscious
shame, the other with that bitterness of spirit, arising from the
recollection of repeated disappointments of a similar nature to those
described.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> It is this demand of “money on account” that first removes
the film from the eyes of the unhappy client. He then discovers the full
horror of his situation. Expenses have been incurred, and to retreat
will involve him in a certain loss. He therefore determines to proceed,
but with terror in his looks, and despair at his heart.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> All chancery writs are sealed, which, being a mere matter
of form, is done in a moment. Certain days, however, are appointed for
this ceremony, and should any pressing business occur at any other time,
it is necessary to pay a fee of two guineas to open the seal, as it is
called.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> I recommend no man to attach his adversary for want of
appearance or answer&mdash;let a defendant take his own time. The allowed
costs of an attachment are somewhere about eight shillings and two
pence, upon tendering which sum the defendant is entitled to be
discharged from his contempt, although the plaintiff may have incurred
an expense of 20<i>l.</i> in executing the process, and carrying his opponent
to goal. Another instance of the propriety with which this court is
denominated a “court of equity.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Should a solicitor be negligent in his business, the clerk
in court will amuse himself for years with handing alternative notes of
“Answer or Attachment” to the adverse clerk in court, without the least
probability of any attention ever being paid to them. In every case this
ridiculous courtesy is productive of much unnecessary delay. The order
for time is equally useless and absurd. A defendant in a country cause
is entitled as of course to two; one for six weeks, and another for a
month. Why could he not be allowed to claim the time he is thus entitled
to without this mummery and expense.</p></div>

unknown; once captain of Militia, now master in chancery? His
qualifications for the latter office are said to have been discovered by
the late Lord Chancellor in the gallant exertions he displayed in
assisting his Lordship and Lady Eldon out of the kennel, in which a
broken down carriage had left them sprawling. Any scavenger would have
done as much. Gratitude on this occasion really carried his Lordship too
far, but as the only instance on record of any thing like feeling in his
character, it is well worthy of admiration. The military genius of
Captain Cross still displays itself in the repeated vollies of fire,
ending in smoke, with which he attacks all those who have courage enough
to dispute his erroneous opinions.</p></div>

interrogations prepared and signed by counsel: a most wretched and
ineffectual system of extracting truth. The execution of the commission
is entrusted to friends of the solicitors in the cause, and the
witnesses are all previously well tutored as to what it is expected of
them to swear. The proceedings are always conducted at an inn, where the
solicitors, commissioners and witnesses, drown all their animosities in
the sociability of the table. Every day is provided at the expense of
the litigant parties a dinner, at which the viands and wines are the
very best and most expensive that the house can afford. Liberal
potations of course produce head-aches, for which there is nothing so
wholesome as air and exercise. Business is thus frequently neglected for
the sports of the field. Can any censure be too severe for such
iniquity?</p></div>

on many trifling grounds, which is another serious grievance arising out
of the mode of taking evidence in the Court of Chancery. I was some time

“evangelists” in a jurat, actually caused an expense to the plaintiff of

which he frequently cites as “The Book on Powers.” He has great talent,
and has also the wit to know it. The Sussex election, at which he was so
hastily “perused and settled” by Sir Godfrey Webster must be fresh in
public recollection. His conduct more recently, on proposing himself for
a borough, and offering to be guided in his politics by the wishes of
the electors, deserves severe reprehension; but for this perhaps he is
sufficiently punished by the exposure of his correspondence to that

merit, but which, it was said, he never wrote. This work, however, and
his affectation of extraordinary piety seem to have been the cause of
his elevation to a dignity, for which he was totally incompetent. His
behaviour in court was occasionally that of an ideot. When on the
circuit, the door of the town-hall must not creak, nor he be kept a
moment from his dinner under any circumstances. His ill-temper exposed
him to continual quarrels with the counsel, and whenever he found
himself in the wrong, he talked of behaving towards one he might have
offended with the patience of a Christian judge.</p></div>

what must be the situation of Heald’s client;&mdash;of whom the adverse
counsel may state what he pleases as alledged in the pleadings without
the fear of contradiction; for how can the other know whether it be true

as a conveyancer. He is the editor of a work called, Shepherd’s

the early part of his career he obtained some reputation for talent, but
much of it has passed away. He is vainer of his oratorical powers than a
peacock of its tail, but the bird has this advantage over the man, that
others unite in admiration of its feathers; while Preston is compelled
to be satisfied with his own applause. He once formed a project, very
ingenious no doubt, for cultivating some of the barren moors in
Devonshire, but in attempting to carry it into effect, he was, I
believe, nearly ruined.</p></div>

is blind and deaf. The following dialogue is said to have taken place
between South and a solicitor. Sol. “I shall be obliged Mr. South by
your letting me have the short order as soon as possible.” South. “Do

court where all pleadings are filed. The principal duty of the clerks in
court is to copy the pleadings (for which he is allowed 10<i>d.</i> a folio)
and to assist the masters in taxing costs at the rate of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for
every hour or for every twenty folios in the length of the bill. They
are all a set of drones, but our friend John Baines really out Hectors

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> Taxation is entirely regulated by custom, and the
principle upon which it is conducted often produces the greatest
injustice as well to the solicitor as to the client. To get a party into
contempt for disobedience to an order of the court a writ of execution
must be taken out and served upon him, and various other expensive
proceedings resorted to; and yet should he obey the order before the
whole process is actually completed, not one sixpence will be allowed
against him in costs. There are other instances equally gross. I have
often argued against such injustice, but have been always answered “this
is our rule, we cannot do otherwise.” Is it not high time that a remedy
should be provided. There are some, who in taxing discretionary charges
as between a solicitor and his client, invariably take off one half of
each item. How must a conscientious solicitor suffer from this mode of
exercising direction! The resource of a less delicate mind is obvious.</p></div>
